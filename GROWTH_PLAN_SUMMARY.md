## The Opportunity

Backpack solves a **real, painful problem** that every AI agent developer faces: managing credentials, state, and personality across environments. The solution is innovative and well-implemented, but it needs strategic improvements to become shareable and viral.

## The Strategy

Make Backpack **instantly tryable, immediately valuable, and naturally shareable** by:

1. **Removing friction** - One-command installation
2. **Showing value fast** - Quick start wizard + templates
3. **Enabling sharing** - Templates, examples, demos
4. **Polishing experience** - Better CLI, errors, docs

## The Plan

### 🚀 Quick Wins (Do First - 6 hours total)

3. **Agent Templates** (4-6h) - 3 ready-to-use agents
4. **Demo Command** (2-3h) - `backpack demo`
5. **Enhanced README** (1-2h) - Better first impression

**Impact**: Transforms Backpack from "interesting project" to "must-try tool"
