**Backpack** is a secure, portable system for managing AI agents with encrypted state, credentials, and personality configurations. It solves the "Naked Agent" problem by providing a unified container format that travels with your agent code in version control.

## Why Backpack?

| Pain point | Without Backpack | With Backpack |
|------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Credentials** | Scattered in `.env`, dashboards, or copy-paste | One vault; JIT injection with one prompt per key |
| **Sharing agents** | "Clone repo, then manually add keys and config" | Clone → `backpack run agent.py` → allow keys when prompted |
| **Personality/config** | Hardcoded or random config files | Version-controlled in `agent.lock` with the code |
| **Secrets on disk** | `.env` or config in plain text | Keys only in OS keychain; never plain text in repo |
| **Cloud Deployment** | Manual env var setup per service | Automated via Master Key & Encrypted Portability |
| **Time to first run** | Find keys, create `.env`, restart | `backpack quickstart` → add keys → run in minutes |

## Quick Start (3 steps)

```bash
pip install backpack-agent
backpack quickstart          # Interactive wizard: name, credentials, personality
backpack key add OPENAI_API_KEY   # Add your keys when prompted
backpack run agent.py        # Run with JIT injection
```

Or use a ready-made template:

```bash
backpack template list
backpack template use financial_analyst
backpack key add OPENAI_API_KEY
backpack run agent.py
```

## The Problem: "The Naked Agent"

Right now, an agent is just code. It has no state and no keys until a developer manually injects them.

- **Code**: Public (GitHub)
- **Secrets**: Private (Scattered in `.env` or cloud dashboards)
- **Memory**: Private (Stuck in a specific vector database)

This creates friction when sharing agents, managing credentials, and maintaining state across environments.

## The Solution: Encrypted Agent Containers

Backpack creates an `agent.lock` file that travels with the agent's code in the git repo. This file contains three distinct encrypted "variable" layers:

### Layer 1: Credentials (The Keys)

**Content**: Placeholders for `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `TWITTER_TOKEN`, etc.

**Innovation**: When a user clones the agent, the system sees the `agent.lock`. It checks the user's personal local keychain. If the user has a "Global OpenAI Key" saved, it automatically injects it into the agent's encrypted runtime. No manual `.env` setup required.

### Layer 2: Personality & System Prompts (The Brain)

**Content**: "You are a senior financial analyst. Use a formal tone."

**Innovation**: These are variables that can be tweaked and version-controlled. A team can update the "Personality Variable" in Git, and everyone's local agent updates instantly upon `git pull`.

### Layer 3: Ephemeral Memory (The Context)

**Content**: User ID, Session History, last tool output.

**Innovation**: Local-first memory. The agent writes its "short-term memory" to an encrypted local file. This means you can stop an agent on your laptop, commit the encrypted state, push it to a server, and the agent resumes exactly where it left off.

## Features

- 🔐 **Encrypted State Management**: All agent data is encrypted using PBKDF2 and Fernet
- ☁️ **Cloud Ready**: Seamless deployment to Vercel/Railway with Master Key support
- 🔑 **OS Keychain Integration**: Secure credential storage using platform-native keyrings
- 🚀 **JIT Variable Injection**: Just-in-time credential injection with user consent
- 📦 **Portable Containers**: `agent.lock` files travel with your code in version control
- 🧠 **Version-Controlled Personality**: System prompts and configuration in Git
- 💾 **Ephemeral Memory**: Encrypted state that can be committed and shared
- 🛡️ **No Plain Text Secrets**: Keys never written to disk in plain text

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip

### Install from PyPI (recommended)
 
 ```bash
 pip install backpack-agent
 ```

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd backpack
pip install -e .
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
backpack --help
```

## Quick Start

**Option A – Interactive wizard (fastest):**

```bash
backpack quickstart
# Answer: agent name, credentials (e.g. OPENAI_API_KEY), personality
backpack key add OPENAI_API_KEY   # and any other keys
backpack run agent.py
```

**Option B – Manual init:**

```bash
backpack key add OPENAI_API_KEY
backpack key add TWITTER_TOKEN
backpack init --credentials "OPENAI_API_KEY,TWITTER_TOKEN" --personality "You are a senior financial analyst. Use a formal tone."
backpack run example_agent.py
```

**Option C – Use a template:**

```bash
backpack template list
backpack template use financial_analyst   # or twitter_bot, code_reviewer
backpack key add OPENAI_API_KEY
backpack run agent.py
```

**See the value in 30 seconds:**

```bash
backpack demo
```

For detailed usage, see [USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md).

## Templates & Examples

Ready-made agents you can run immediately:

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `financial_analyst` | Formal, data-driven analyst persona; uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `twitter_bot` | Friendly Twitter bot; uses `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN` |
| `code_reviewer` | Constructive code review; uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` |

```bash
backpack template list
backpack template use <name>
```

Each template includes a README and a runnable `agent.py` you can customize.

## Testing

Backpack includes a comprehensive test suite using pytest.

### Running Tests

Tests can run **without installing** the package (conftest.py adds `src` to `PYTHONPATH`):

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run all tests (no pip install -e . required)
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_crypto.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

Alternatively, install in editable mode first: `pip install -e .`

### Logging

Backpack uses Python's standard `logging` module:

- Library modules (`crypto`, `keychain`, `agent_lock`) log at module level
- The CLI configures a default logger when invoked
- Control verbosity with the `BACKPACK_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
  (e.g. `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`):

```bash
BACKPACK_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG backpack run agent.py
```

No secret values (keys, ciphertext, plaintext) are ever written to logs.

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- ✅ Encryption/decryption operations
- ✅ Keychain storage and retrieval
- ✅ Agent lock file management
- ✅ CLI command execution
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases

See `htmlcov/index.html` after running with coverage for detailed coverage reports.

## Architecture

Backpack implements a three-layer encryption system:

1. **Credentials Layer**: Stores placeholders for required API keys
2. **Personality Layer**: Stores system prompts and agent configuration
3. **Memory Layer**: Stores ephemeral agent state

All layers are encrypted using PBKDF2 key derivation and Fernet symmetric encryption. The master key can be set via the `AGENT_MASTER_KEY` environment variable.

For detailed architecture documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

- No plain text secrets on disk
- User consent prompts for credential access

## The "JIT" Variable Injection Workflow

This is where the "GitHub of Secret Management" thinking revolutionizes agents.

### Current Workflow (Bad):

1. Agent tries to run
2. Agent crashes because `TWITTER_API_KEY` is missing
3. User goes to Twitter Developer Portal, generates key, pastes into `.env`
4. Restart

### Backpack "Agent Passport" Workflow:

1. Agent initializes
2. It reads `agent.lock` and sees it needs `TWITTER_API_KEY`
3. **Intervention**: Instead of crashing, the CLI pauses execution and prompts:
   ```
   This agent requires access to Twitter. You have a Twitter key in your personal vault. Allow access? (Y/n)
   ```
4. **Grant**: User hits 'Y'. The CLI decrypts the key only into the agent's process memory
5. The agent runs. The key is never written to disk in plain text
