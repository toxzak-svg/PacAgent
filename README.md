# Backpack: Encrypted Agent Container System

**Backpack** is a secure, portable system for managing AI agents with encrypted state, credentials, and personality configurations. It solves the "Naked Agent" problem by providing a unified container format that travels with your agent code in version control.

## The Problem: "The Naked Agent"

Right now, an agent is just code. It has no state and no keys until a developer manually injects them.

- **Code**: Public (GitHub)
- **Secrets**: Private (Scattered in `.env` or cloud dashboards)
- **Memory**: Private (Stuck in a specific vector database)

This creates friction when sharing agents, managing credentials, and maintaining state across environments.

## The Solution: Encrypted Agent Containers

Backpack creates an `agent.lock` file that travels with the agent's code in the git repo. This file contains three distinct encrypted "variable" layers:

### Layer 1: Credentials (The Keys)

**Content**: Placeholders for `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `TWITTER_TOKEN`, etc.

**Innovation**: When a user clones the agent, the system sees the `agent.lock`. It checks the user's personal local keychain. If the user has a "Global OpenAI Key" saved, it automatically injects it into the agent's encrypted runtime. No manual `.env` setup required.

### Layer 2: Personality & System Prompts (The Brain)

**Content**: "You are a senior financial analyst. Use a formal tone."

**Innovation**: These are variables that can be tweaked and version-controlled. A team can update the "Personality Variable" in Git, and everyone's local agent updates instantly upon `git pull`.

### Layer 3: Ephemeral Memory (The Context)

**Content**: User ID, Session History, last tool output.

**Innovation**: Local-first memory. The agent writes its "short-term memory" to an encrypted local file. This means you can stop an agent on your laptop, commit the encrypted state, push it to a server, and the agent resumes exactly where it left off.

## Features

- 🔐 **Encrypted State Management**: All agent data is encrypted using PBKDF2 and Fernet
- 🔑 **OS Keychain Integration**: Secure credential storage using platform-native keyrings
- 🚀 **JIT Variable Injection**: Just-in-time credential injection with user consent
- 📦 **Portable Containers**: `agent.lock` files travel with your code in version control
- 🧠 **Version-Controlled Personality**: System prompts and configuration in Git
- 💾 **Ephemeral Memory**: Encrypted state that can be committed and shared
- 🛡️ **No Plain Text Secrets**: Keys never written to disk in plain text

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip

### Install from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd backpack

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
python backpack.py --help
```

## Quick Start

1. **Add keys to your personal vault:**
   ```bash
   python backpack.py key add OPENAI_API_KEY
   python backpack.py key add TWITTER_TOKEN
   ```

2. **Initialize an agent:**
   ```bash
   python backpack.py init --credentials "OPENAI_API_KEY,TWITTER_TOKEN" --personality "You are a senior financial analyst. Use a formal tone."
   ```

3. **Run the agent:**
   ```bash
   python backpack.py run example_agent.py
   ```

For detailed usage instructions, see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

## Testing

Backpack includes a comprehensive test suite using pytest.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_crypto.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- ✅ Encryption/decryption operations
- ✅ Keychain storage and retrieval
- ✅ Agent lock file management
- ✅ CLI command execution
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases

See `htmlcov/index.html` after running with coverage for detailed coverage reports.

## Architecture

Backpack implements a three-layer encryption system:

1. **Credentials Layer**: Stores placeholders for required API keys
2. **Personality Layer**: Stores system prompts and agent configuration
3. **Memory Layer**: Stores ephemeral agent state

All layers are encrypted using PBKDF2 key derivation and Fernet symmetric encryption. The master key can be set via the `AGENT_MASTER_KEY` environment variable.

For detailed architecture documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Security

Backpack prioritizes security through:

- Encrypted storage of all agent data
- OS-native keychain integration
- No plain text secrets on disk
- User consent prompts for credential access

## The "JIT" Variable Injection Workflow

This is where the "GitHub of Secret Management" thinking revolutionizes agents.

### Current Workflow (Bad):

1. Agent tries to run
2. Agent crashes because `TWITTER_API_KEY` is missing
3. User goes to Twitter Developer Portal, generates key, pastes into `.env`
4. Restart

### Backpack "Agent Passport" Workflow:

1. Agent initializes
2. It reads `agent.lock` and sees it needs `TWITTER_API_KEY`
3. **Intervention**: Instead of crashing, the CLI pauses execution and prompts:
   ```
   This agent requires access to Twitter. You have a Twitter key in your personal vault. Allow access? (Y/n)
   ```
4. **Grant**: User hits 'Y'. The CLI decrypts the key only into the agent's process memory
5. The agent runs. The key is never written to disk in plain text
