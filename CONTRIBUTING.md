   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backpack.git
   cd backpack
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash

   ```

4. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   backpack --help
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main`: Stable, production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: New features
- `fix/*`: Bug fixes
- `docs/*`: Documentation updates

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Write clear, readable code
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add docstrings to new functions/classes
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes:**
   ```bash
   # Test the CLI
   backpack --help
   backpack key list
   
   # Test with example agent
   backpack init --credentials "TEST_KEY" --personality "Test agent"
   backpack run example_agent.py
   ```

4. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```

5. **Push and create a pull request:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Code Style

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Docstring Format

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def function_name(param1: str, param2: int) -> bool:
    """
    Brief description of the function.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2
    
    Returns:
        Description of return value
    
    Raises:
        ExceptionType: When this exception is raised
    """
    pass
```

### Import Organization

1. Standard library imports
2. Third-party imports
3. Local application imports

Example:
```python
import os
import json
from typing import Dict, Optional

import click
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

from .agent_lock import AgentLock
from .keychain import store_key
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Before submitting a pull request, test:

1. **Key management:**
   ```bash
   backpack key add TEST_KEY
   backpack key list
   backpack key remove TEST_KEY
   ```

2. **Agent initialization:**
   ```bash
   backpack init --credentials "KEY1,KEY2" --personality "Test"
   ```

3. **Agent execution:**
   ```bash
   backpack run example_agent.py
   ```

4. **Error handling:**
   - Missing agent.lock file
   - Missing keys in keychain
   - Invalid master key
   - Corrupted agent.lock file
